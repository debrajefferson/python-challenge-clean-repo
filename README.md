# python-challenge-clean-repo
# THIS IS THE CHALLENGE 3 REPO TO USE, PLEASE IGNORE REPO NAMED python-challenge
#
# UPDATE: I changed the code to not invoke pandas now.
# UPDATE: I also used this opportunity to create a new repo and upload all the files from a fresh start to help us both avoid the painful # mess in the initially submitted repo (see notes below).  :-)
# I did have to research the strip and split functions for python online, I drew from questions and answers in quora and stackoverflow.

# python-challenge
# This is where I will upload my Module 3 Challenge items.
#
# Ookkkaaaayyyy... let me start off by apologizing to whoever is trying to grade this assignment.
# GitHub is fast becoming my archenemy.  It appears I've managed to upload and commit two duplicate # copies of the PyBank folders.  Please look for the PyBank folder under the python-challenge folder.
# Also, I had a typo for the initial commit for "PyPoll"... I accidentally typed "PyRoll" with an "R" in error.  I will attempt to load a folder with the correct spelling.
# Who knew the coding and data analysis stuff would be the "easiest" part of this course? 
# Turns out the real challenge is GitHub,GitBash, GitLab, and my own darn Command application are 
# all conspiring to kill me.
# Have a great week!
